# Biting the Apple: Unlocking macOS with Python

This is a presentation I am preparing for [hsv.py](https://www.meetup.com/hsv-py/).

It is a work in progress.

## Building the Presentation

The presentating is built using [marp](https://marp.app/).
After installing marp, you can build the presentation with the following command:

```bash
rm -f biting-the-apple.html && marp biting-the-apple.md --html --allow-local-files
```
